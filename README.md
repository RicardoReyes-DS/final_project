# Final Project

## Introduction 

For my final project I chose to realize a Supervised Model using Linear Regression and an Unsupervised Model of Clusterization. 

The supervised model was trained to pedrict popularity using Spotify's API to collect data such as audio feautes, popularity index, genres, related artists, top tracks.

The unsupervised model realized a clusterization of the tracks using Tempo, Popularity and Danceability data.

On the first file you can find the process I used to realize web scraping on my favorite blog of avant-garde music nodata.tv (data was obtained from them...)

The second file shows my process of linking the artist present on Spotify, linking them them with related artists, obtaining the top songs, and audio features for each song.

The third file is my approach to predict track popularity via the data obtained. Here I used a Linear Regression Model.

On the fourth and final file, my approach to an Unsupervised Clusterization is described. I might upload the link of the final playlist from one of the clusters. 

Also I'll take more time to explain the idea behind this project.
